# insight-sales-revenue

Create a new page called Dashboard with this layout:

- A header section at the top with a placeholder for the company name and logo
- The main content area split into 4 equal sections:
   1. Sales metrics
   2. Revenue metrics 
   3. Other key metrics
   4. Summary and highlights

In each of the 4 main sections, add a heading and some placeholder text for now. We'll fill in the actual metrics and data later.

Use a clean and professional looking layout. Include some subtle background colors to visually separate the sections.
